Python wrapper around Windows Azure storage and management REST APIs

Based on Sriram Krishnan's original work:
http://www.sriramkrishnan.com/blog/2008/11/python-wrapper-for-windows-azure.html

Project structure and delete blob operation borrowed from @livenson:
https://github.com/livenson/winazurestorage/tree/9ed4f0f5e764c3f0086c49dfa9acfde42091c131

There is a project with the same name on Google Code, but it seems abandoned:
http://code.google.com/p/pyazure/

Management API functionality written and integrated by Blair Bethwaite (bmb@github.com).
